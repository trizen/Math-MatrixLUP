=head1 NAME

Math::MatrixLUP - Matrix operations and LUP decomposition.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Math::MatrixLUP;

    my $A = [
        [2, -1,  5,  1],
        [3,  2,  2, -6],
        [1,  3,  3, -1],
        [5, -2, -3,  3],
    ];

    my $LUP = Math::MatrixLUP->new($A);

    my $det = $LUP->determinant;
    my $sol = $LUP->solve([-3, -32, -47, 49]);
    my $inv = $LUP->invert;
    my $exp = $LUP->pow(3);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Math::MatrixLUP provides generic support for matrix operations and LUP decomposition, allowing any type of numbers inside the matrix, including native Perl numbers and numerical objects provided by other mathematical libraries, such as L<Math::AnyNum>.

The supported matrix operations are:

=over 2

=item * matrix-scalar arithmetical operation

=item * matrix multiplication

=item * matrix exponentiation

=item * computing the determinant of a square-matrix

=item * inverting a square-matrix

=item * solving a system of linear equations
